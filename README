Extension:FacebookConversionPixel
=====================================

All the extension does is add the Facebook Custom Audience (or Conversion) Pixel code.
It only has a single configuration option - your pixel id:
	$egFacebookPixelId = '123456789098765';

Description by Facebook:
Custom Audiences from your Website allows you to target your
Facebook ads to audiences of people who have visited your website
and remarket to people who have expressed interest in your products.
