FacebookConversionPixel extension for MediaWiki
===============================================

This MediaWiki extension does one simple thing: add the
Facebook Custom Audience (or Conversion) Pixel code.

It only has one mandatory and one optional configuration options:

* Mandatory - Your pixel ID: `$egFacebookPixelId           = '123456789098765';`
* Optional - set to true to run script in <head>: `$egFacebookPixelHighPriority = false;`

Facebook's description of Custom Audiences:
> Custom Audiences from your Website allows you to target your
> Facebook ads to audiences of people who have visited your website
> and remarket to people who have expressed interest in your products.
